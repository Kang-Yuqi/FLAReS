# FLAReS
**FLAReS** (**F**ull-sky **L**ensing with **A**daptive **Re**solution **S**hells) provides a python package for full-sky weak lensing simulations with non-Gaussianity analysis. 

## Characteristics
* Construct spherical lens shell from Nbody boxes.
* Efficient Nboy box arrangement for lens shells in differnt redshift.
* Measure non-Gaussianity parameters (Skewness & Kurtosis) of lensing maps either locally or globally.

## Example 
* A quarter cross-section view (to scale) of the lens shell arrangement and stacking of hierarchical N-body simulation boxes used to simulate full-sky CMB lensing. The shells are distinguished by different colors, and the grid represents the scaled N-body box.

* N-body box stacking strategies for constructing one of the lensing shells.
