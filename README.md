# QingLong
QingLong provides a python package for full-sky CMB lensing simulations with non-Gaussianity analysis. 

## Characteristics
* Construct spherical lens shell from Nbody boxes.
* Efficient Nboy box arrangement for lens shells in differnt redshift.
* Measure non-Gaussianity parameters (Skewness & Kurtosis) of lensing maps either locally or globally, at arbitary redshifts.
