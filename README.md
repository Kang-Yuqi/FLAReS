# QingLong
QingLong provides a python package for full-sky CMB lensing simulations with non-Gaussianity analysis. 

## Characteristics
* Construct spherical lens shell from Nbody boxes.
* Efficient Nboy box arrangement for lens shells in differnt redshift.
* Measure non-Gaussianity parameters (Skewness & Kurtosis) of lensing maps either locally or globally, at arbitary redshifts.

## Example 
* A quarter cross-section view of the lens shell arrangement and stacking of hierarchical N-body simulation boxes used to simulate full-sky CMB lensing. The shells are distinguished by different colors, and the grid represents the scaled N-body box.

* A comparison between the CAMB predicted CMB lensing power spectrum and the power spectrum measured from the simulated map.
